## Examples

### Telegram

You can use the webhook trigger to send a message to a telegram channel. Enable `Use a custom webhook body`.

Set the URL to `https://api.telegram.org/bot[BOT_TOKEN]/sendMessage`. Replace [BOT_TOKEN] with your bot token.

```json
{
	"chat_id": "[CHAT_ID]", // Replace [CHAT_ID] with your chat id
	"text": "<b>${alert_name}</b>\n\n<b>Severity:</b> <code>${severity}</code>\n<b>Status:</b> ${status}\n<b>Source:</b> Kener\n<b>Time:</b> ${timestamp}\n\nüìå <b>Details:</b>\n- <b>Metric:</b>${metric}\n- <b>Current Value:</b> <code>${current_value}</code>\n- <b>Threshold:</b> <code>${threshold}</code>\n\nüîç <a href=\"${action_url}\">${action_text}</a>",
	"parse_mode": "HTML"
}
```

If you want to send a message to a group, then replace `[CHAT_ID]` with the group id.

You can also use environment variables to store the bot token and chat id. In that case the URL will be `https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage`. In the body you can use `"chat_id": "$CHAT_ID"`. Make sure you have set the `BOT_TOKEN` and `CHAT_ID` in the <a href="/docs/environment-vars#secrets">environment variables</a>.
